# Hello and Welcome!

My name is Nengi Harry, I chose to pursue a career in Data Science with the goal of utilizing analytics as a business consulting tool.

The intent of this portfolio is to highlight my ability to analyze data, and present insights gained for both technical and non-technical audiences.

When I am not working, I enjoy watching and implementing “DIY” videos and projects with my five-year-old daughter.
